        "EarlyLife": "Albert Einstein was a German-born physicist who revolutionized science with his theory of relativity, particularly the equation E = mc¬≤, which demonstrated the relationship between mass and energy. Born in 1879, he struggled in traditional schooling but later excelled in physics, earning a degree from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. In 1905, his 'miracle year', he published groundbreaking papers on the photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, special relativity, and mass-energy equivalence, earning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. His work laid the foundation for quantum mechanics and modern cosmology. Fleeing Nazi Germany in 1933, he moved to the U.S. and contributed to the development of the atomic bomb, though he later became a strong advocate for peace and nuclear disarmament. Einstein's legacy extends beyond science, as he symbolized intellectual curiosity and humanitarian values until his death in 1955.",

Later, he became a professor at several prestigious institutions, including the University of Zurich, the University of Prague, and the University of Berlin.",
        "Struggle": "Despite his later fame, Einstein faced several struggles early in life. He was considered a slow learner as a child and faced difficulties in finding a stable academic position after graduation. His unorthodox methods and revolutionary ideas were initially met with resistance from the scientific community. Additionally, he had to leave Germany in 1933 due to the rise of the Nazi regime, moving to the United States, where he took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.",

His study on the photoelectric effect demonstrated how light could behave as both a particle and a wave. Einstein also worked on the Brownian motion, explaining the random motion of particles suspended in a fluid.

He studied chemical engineering at Oregon State University before earning a PhD in chemistry and mathematical physics from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1925. His groundbreaking research on chemical bonding and molecular structures positioned him as one of the leading scientists of the 20th century. He later expanded his work into biology and medicine, advocating for the health benefits of vitamin C.",
        "Struggle": "Pauling faced financial struggles during his early education, often working multiple jobs to support himself. His outspoken political activism, particularly against nuclear weapons testing, led to conflicts with the U.S. government, including passport revocation and accusations of communist ties during the McCarthy era. Despite this, he persisted in his scientific and humanitarian efforts, standing firm in his beliefs.",
        "Acheivement": "A two-time unshared Nobel laureate, Pauling won the 1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research on the nature of chemical bonds and the 1962 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts against nuclear weapons. He played a key role in shaping modern chemistry, molecular biology, and medical research. His advocacy contributed to the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, demonstrating the impact of science on global policy.",
        "Research": "Pauling's work in quantum chemistry revolutionized our understanding of molecular interactions. He introduced the concept of hybrid orbitals and resonance, which are fundamental in chemistry today. His research extended into medicine, where he proposed the role of vitamin C in health and disease prevention.

        "Related1": "Nelson Mandela studied at the University College of Fort Hare and later at the University of Witwatersrand, where he was one of few Black law students. His education shaped his understanding of justice and equality. Despite facing racial discrimination, he completed his law degree and opened South Africa's first Black-owned law firm with Oliver Tambo. His commitment to education continued throughout his life, even studying via correspondence during his imprisonment.",

        "Related3": "Mother Teresa studied at a convent-run school in Skopje before joining the Sisters of Loreto in Ireland, where she learned English and began her religious training. She continued her novitiate in India, where she studied theology and became a teacher at St. Mary‚Äôs High School in Calcutta. Her experiences in the classroom and among the poor shaped her deep sense of compassion and service. In 1950, she founded the Missionaries of Charity, emphasizing not only acts of mercy but also the spiritual education of her sisters, fostering a life of humility, discipline, and devotion.",
